Code is based on [Robert Sedgwich's talk](http://www.cs.princeton.edu/~rs/talks/LLRB/RedBlack.pdf "Left Leaning Red Black Tree") and its [java implementation](http://www.cs.princeton.edu/~rs/talks/LLRB/Java/).
It has invariant checking methods that were in the java implementation removed. 

Note: There is a bug in the remove() code. See Lee Stanza's left-leaning red-black tree implementation at
