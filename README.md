Code is based on [Robert Sedgwich's talk](http://www.cs.princeton.edu/~rs/talks/LLRB/RedBlack.pdf "Left Leaning Red Black Tree") and its [java implementation](http://www.cs.princeton.edu/~rs/talks/LLRB/Java/).
The C++ version has the invariant checking methods that were in the java implementation removed.
